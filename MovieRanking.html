    <h1>The Best Movies According to Jatin</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Bajrangi Bhaijaan</h3>
    <p>Bajrangi Bhaijaan is my favorite because it beautifully blends emotion, humanity, and adventure. The story of a simple, kind-hearted man helping a mute Pakistani girl reunite with her family crosses borders and hearts. It teaches love, empathy, and courage without violence. Every scene feels honest, and the bond between Bajrangi and Munni is unforgettable.</p>
    <h3>All of us are dead</h3>
    <p>All of Us Are Dead is my favorite because it mixes intense zombie action with deep emotional stories. The show isn’t just about survival—it’s about friendship, betrayal, love, and growing up in chaos. Every character feels real, and the tension keeps you hooked. It shows how fear can bring out both the worst and the best in people.</p>
    <h3>Charlie 777</h3>
    <p>777 Charlie is my favorite because it’s a heartwarming journey of love, healing, and companionship between a lonely man and a stray dog. The bond between Dharma and Charlie shows how a pet can change a person’s life completely. The film beautifully portrays emotions without needing many words—it’s pure, touching, and full of soul. It reminds us that sometimes, the ones who save us don’t speak our language—they just love us unconditionally.
